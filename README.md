## Overview
The Linear Regression Assumptions Validation Tool is an interactive web application designed to simplify the process of validating the assumptions of linear regression. Built using Python and deployed on Streamlit Cloud, this tool provides users with an intuitive interface to upload datasets, generate diagnostic plots, and perform statistical tests.

## Features
- **Diagnostic Plots**:
  - Generate QQ plots to check normality of residuals.
  - Create residual plots to inspect homoscedasticity and model fit.
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - Perform tests for normality, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity.
- **Data Upload and Processing**:
  - Accept user-uploaded datasets for automated validation.
  - Process and analyze data seamlessly to provide actionable insights.
- **Visualization**:
  - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating high-quality diagnostic plots.
- **Deployment**:
  - Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for ease of access and interactive data exploration.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
